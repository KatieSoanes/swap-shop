# Opening message: 
**Swap Shop** is a fictitious company and website. Firstly, the premise behind a Swap Shop; it is an event where people gather and bring X number of clothing items typically there is a minimum item number you must bring for example 5, the items must be cleaned and in great condition. People swap their clothing items to take home another persons preloved items with no additional cost. 

It is for people wanting to make more environmentally-conscious fashion decisions, and to give items of clothing a new lease of life exchanging your pre-loved items for another persons treasure. It is also an opportunity to socliase and meet new people. Any items not swapped will be given to charity as long as the person is happy to donate them. Swap Shop provides a slow fashion alternative to purchasing fast fashion which is responsible for water pollution, high carbon emissions and a large amount of landfill waste. 

The site is targeted at those interested in fashion, the environment and, as it is a Swap Shop event it is also a very sociable occasion where people can make friends and meet like minded individuals.

Both of the above, the information wanted is located on the landing page and also the pin of the google map shows the location has not changed. 

# Site Owner

1. As a site owner, I want users to learn about Swap Shop (get the brand name spreading).
* The brand name is centered on each of the five pages, the white text is a contrasting colour to the blue background, making it stand out.
The image of the models backstage at a fashion show, immediatley makes you understand this brand is fashion related. The off white clothing being worn by the models, corresponds to the white Swap Shop logo making a simplistic correlation between the two. 
<img width="1437" alt="Screenshot 2021-07-11 at 17 56 55" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84447603/125203695-70685680-e271-11eb-8345-2cde652d3c2d.png">

2. As a site owner, I want users to be able to sign up for upcoming events.
3. As a site owner, I want users to know the exact location of events. 
4. As a site owner, I want users to know why swapping is a great alternative to fast fashion.
Regarding all of the above statments, they have been covered within the user stories and returning user sections. 

5. As a site owner, I want users to be able to view the website on different devices e.g. mobile,
tablet.
* This was done by applying responsive imagery to ensure the website looks well  on different screen sizes and improves performance across different sites. 
* Example shown below the image of the girls on a regular laptop screen is on the right, but when shrunk down to a mobile size of 320px the image is above the title.

# Design
**colour scheme**
<img width="1431" alt="Screenshot 2021-07-11 at 21 18 25" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84447603/125208947-8e43b480-e28d-11eb-9db0-ebfa60d9ff7f.png">
The three main colours used are blue, white and a red-orange shade. I felt these colours really compliment one another and the colours together have a very alluring effect. Blue is a naturally calming colour and it is soothing so it makes the user feel relaxed upon arrivial to the site. 

# Typography 
Open Sans is used with a back up of Sans Serif (the reason for the backup: if for any reason the font isn’t being imported correctly to the site). The reason this font was chosen is because it is very easily legible and aesthetically pleasing. 

# Imagery 
Throughout the website there are an array of images all based around fashion for example catwalk fashion images, images of clothing rails and images of people who attended past events.
The reason I went for the imagery used is to capture the visitors attention. On **our ethos** page, each picture reflects the topic being discussed for example cost and socialise with an image of a money bank and two friends. Images are easier to process than reading words of text so I feel the images really enhance the website and add a fashionable aspect. As John Medina said
>Hear a piece of information, and three days later you’ll remember 10% of it. Add a picture, and you’ll remember 65%
