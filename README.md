# Opening message: 
**Swap Shop** is a fictitious company and website. Firstly, the premise behind a Swap Shop; it is an event where people gather and bring X number of clothing items typically there is a minimum item number you must bring for example 5, the items must be cleaned and in great condition. People swap their clothing items to take home another persons preloved items with no additional cost. 

It is for people wanting to make more environmentally-conscious fashion decisions, and to give items of clothing a new lease of life exchanging your pre-loved items for another persons treasure. It is also an opportunity to socliase and meet new people. Any items not swapped will be given to charity as long as the person is happy to donate them. Swap Shop provides a slow fashion alternative to purchasing fast fashion which is responsible for water pollution, high carbon emissions and a large amount of landfill waste. 

The site is targeted at those interested in fashion, the environment and, as it is a Swap Shop event it is also a very sociable occasion where people can make friends and meet like minded individuals. 

A brief intro to the website itself: 

## Home Page
The home page provides information on what Swap Shop is (our story), when and where the event occurs (a google map embed). 

## Our Ethos 
Our Ethos shows the ethos of the brand and the importance of making environmentally friendly decisions and how we can all make a positive impact on the environment by attending a swap event. Our ethos goes into the reasoning behind
**why we should swap?**
1. Environment
1. Cost
1. Socialise
1. Revitalise your Wardrobe

## Gallery
A gallery wall to show past swap events: satisfying users about the actual event with a visual representation.

## Event
The Event page provides information on the rules and how the actual event takes place. 

## Sign-Up 
This page lets individuals sign up and register to participate in an upcoming event. 

# Design
**colour scheme**
The three main colours used are blue, white and a red-orange shade. I felt these colours really compliment one another and it also has a very alluring effect. 

# Typography 
Open Sans is used with a back up of Sans Serif (the reason for the backup: if for any reason the font isn’t being imported correctly to the site). The reason this font was chosen is because it is very easily legible and aesthetically pleasing. 

# Imagery 
Throughout the website there are an array of images all based around fashion for example catwalk fashion images, images of clothing rails and images of people who attended past events.
The reason I went for the imagery used is to capture the visitors attention. On **our ethos** page, each picture reflects the topic being discussed for example cost and socialise with an image of a money bank and two friends. Images are easier to process than reading words of text so I feel the images really enhance the website and add a fashionable aspect. As John Medina said
>Hear a piece of information, and three days later you’ll remember 10% of it. Add a picture, and you’ll remember 65%
