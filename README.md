# Opening message: 
**Swap Shop** is a fictitious company and website. Firstly, the premise behind a Swap Shop; it is an event where people gather and bring X number of clothing items typically there is a minimum item number you must bring for example 5, the items must be cleaned and in great condition. People swap their clothing items to take home another persons preloved items with no additional cost. 

It is for people wanting to make more environmentally-conscious fashion decisions, and to give items of clothing a new lease of life exchanging your pre-loved items for another persons treasure. It is also an opportunity to socliase and meet new people. Any items not swapped will be given to charity as long as the person is happy to donate them. Swap Shop provides a slow fashion alternative to purchasing fast fashion which is responsible for water pollution, high carbon emissions and a large amount of landfill waste. 

The site is targeted at those interested in fashion, the environment and as it is a Swap Shop it is also a very sociable event where people can make friends and meet like minded individuals. The website itself:
