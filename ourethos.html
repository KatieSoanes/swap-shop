        <h3>Why Swap?</h3>
        <br>
        <h2>Environment</h2>
        <p>
            Every year billions of garments are wasted and the fast fashion industry is responsible for having a huge 
            negative impact on our environment: water pollution, high carbon emissions, and large amounts of landfill waste. Did you know, every
            year clothing and textile production releases 1.2 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases. Over 70 million tress are cut down
            each year to make clothes. The fashion industry plays a major part in degrading soil which will lead to a 30% decrease
            in food production if nothing changes over the next 20-50 years. 
            With Swap Shop we are hoping to help you and fellow fashionistas make a positive impact and give your preloved items 
            you no longer want a new home where they will be treasured and loved. Vamping up your wardrobe whilst reducing your 
            environmental footprint…sounds amazing to us here at Swap Shop!
        </p>

        <h2 id="money">Cost</h2>
        <p> 
            As everyone knows shopping for clothing can be really expensive at times. So why spend a lot of money, when 
            you can attend our monthly Swap Shop event at no cost at all. All you have to do is get swapping and freshen up 
            your wardrobe for free.

            <h2 id="socialise">Socialise</h2>
            <p>
                This is a great event to meet and socialise with fellow like minded, environmentally conscious fashionistas out there. 
                You will make new friends and have fabulous chats on the day... who knows striking up a conversation about a graphic 
                printed jumper could blossom into a life time of friendship.

            <h2 id="revitalise">Revitalise your Wardrobe</h2> 
            We all know that phrase “One man’s trash is another man’s treasure”, so why not give your preloved items 
            that you no longer want a new home to be loved and cherished and in return you’ll get some fabulous pieces. 
            Also, don’t forget as this is a swap event you may find some unique pieces you wouldn’t be able to find anywhere else.
