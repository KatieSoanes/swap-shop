       <h1>Why Swap</h1> 
<ul>
<li>Environment</li>
Every year billions of garments are wasted and the fast fashion industry is responsible for having a huge 
negative impact on our environment: water pollution, high carbon emissions, and large amounts of landfill waste. 
With Swap Shop we are hoping to help you and fellow fashionistas make a positive impact and give your preloved items 
you no longer want a new home where they will be treasured and loved. Vamping up your wardrobe whilst reducing your 
environmental footprint…sounds amazing to us here at Swap Shop!

<li>Money on Clothing</li> 
As everyone knows shopping for clothing can be really expensive at times. So why spend a lot of money, when 
you can attend our monthly Swap Shop event at no cost at all. All you have to do is get swapping and freshen up 
your wardrobe for free.

<li>Revitalise your Wardrobe</li>
We all know that phrase “One man’s trash is another man’s treasure”, so why not give your preloved items 
that you no longer want a new home to be loved and cherished and in return you’ll get some fabulous pieces. 
Also, don’t forget as this is a swap event you may find some unique pieces you wouldn’t be able to find anywhere else. 

<li>Socialise</li>
This is a great event to meet and socialise with fellow like minded, environmentally conscious fashionistas out there. 
You will make new friends and have fabulous chats on the day, who knows striking up a conversation about a graphic 
printed jumper could blossom into a life time of friendship.
