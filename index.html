        <p>Our mission at Swap Shop is to provide a women's clothing Swap Shop event once every month falling on the last Saturday of 
            that month, in the heart of Dublin City Centre, located in The Lab Gallery.<br>
            <br>
            Swap Shop is a social event for fellow environmentally friendly fashionistas out there! <br>
            You must bring along a minimum of 5 items of clothing, in great 
            condition to swap with a fellow Swap Shop attendee. <br>
            <br>
            Your preloved items you may no longer want get a new lease of life and in return, you revitalise your wardrobe and you make some new friends along the way. The reason we 
            founded Swap Shop (2021), was to provide an event that promotes slow fashion as fast fashion is having a huge 
            negative impact on our environment. We are also fashion lovers so any excuse to host a swap shop and get talking 
            about fashion is a dream day out. So why not come swap with us? You will be part of a community making 
            environmentally friendly fashion decisions, making a positive impact on our planet.You will revitalise your 
            wardrobe, gaining unique items you may not be able to find anywhere else. Also, did we mention, it’s completely
             FREE, you really can’t go wrong! Anything not sold at our events as long as you are happy to do so will be 
             donated to Enable Ireland. If this all sounds like it’s your cup of tea get ready, set, and let’s get swapping.
